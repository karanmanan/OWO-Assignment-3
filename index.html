								<h3 class="major">Eric Chau (s3920350)</h3>
								<p>I’m a 23-year-old Chinese/Vietnamese student who was born and raised in the beautiful city of Melbourne. I spend most of my time playing video games or working out. The game that I am heavily playing is League of Legends, (whether it’s for enjoyment or just out of addiction is up to you) when I’m not playing LoL I generally enjoy playing action RPGs. When games aren’t on the top of my mind, I’m usually working out. I spend 4 days a week training as I am a competitive powerlifter. A sport where contestants compete for the largest total in the squat, bench, and deadlift. My main interest in IT began in 2012, when I was able to build my own PC which I have only just recently upgraded. I also find enjoyment in picking parts and building PCs for my friends and family. Just recently though, a lot of my interest in IT has stemmed from AI and how a lot of what we use today have AI integration without us thinking about it. Studying at RMIT will in hopes lead me in a direction with the right skillset and mindset once graduating university. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Jacob Conley (s3583306)</h3>
								<p> My background is Australian. I like to play games in particular League of Legends, draw and create with digital creation software. My interest in IT had been developed from a young age admittedly on front-end programs to create like Maya, Adobe Creative Suite and Unity. Recently I have had the desire to continue learning about more back-end technologies in IT and develop my overall knowledge further. I have studied experience of a Cert IV in IT and a Diploma of Interactive media but overall, it's limited and needs to be developed further hence the interest in IT. </p>

								<p> My name is Karanvir Singh Manan(S3905930). I am studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I grew up in the state of Punjab in northern India and moved to Australia in 2016. I graduated from Melton Secondary College in 2020. I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English. I can get very motivated and very lazy depending on my mood. My hobbies are sketching, soccer and listening to music. I got interested in technology when I was around 10 years old, when my father bought me a Tetris game. Fascinated by the game I grew more interested in games and have continued to play games. In high school I learned coding and it answered many of my questions, so I decided to learn more about IT. </p>

								<p> Hi, my name is Danny Nguyen. I am currently 18 years old and taking part in a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. My student Number is S3900170. My background is Vietnamese but I am an Australian citizen. I like to play games, go to the gym , work and listen to music as my hobbies. I love computers, computers are like  toys, fun to play with and makes you happy overall. IT has many different aspects to it but what I like about it is the computer system side to it, like figuring out what PC designs are good. There are so many ways you can build a PC, from small to big or from cheap to expensive. There is so much that PC hardware can do and on top of that IT is the future of society as we are reliant on IT nowadays. I can’t wait to explore future PC hardware because there is so much to offer with creativity building, it’s like creating your own recipe! Studying a bachelors of IT at RMIT will help me focus on becoming a Technician to help with PC hardware. I So far know how to do a bit of coding with python and PC hardware in terms of Bit coding/Hardware. Hoping I can grow my knowledge to become a better IT Technician.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Description</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Final.PNG" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p>‘Sports Hub’ is an application that assists people in finding various public sporting areas. The type of areas it will include will be, football ovals, soccer pitches, tennis courts and basketball courts and the App will be able to give you directions/information to each public sporting area. This is to promote the use of public sporting areas and get people to socialise through common interests. It does this by helping a user find Clubs and/or Coaches for their desired sports.</p>
								<p>Joining a Club will allow you to be part of an official club that participates regularly and participant in entry level programs for each sport. You can find a club by a browse function where you search for it using a search bar that matches the words to appropriate teams or if a user is unsure but really wants to participate in a sport they can use a fun quiz inside the app in order to be matched to a club and a sport. </p>
								<p>A user will be able to book appointments with coaches and book Indoor areas for their sport. When a user books a coach they can book them as a General inquiry where it would be similar to an introductory lesson where the user would get the general idea how and what will happen in their coaching sessions. They can book as a Personal training session where a user will be able to train 1-on-1 on fundamental skills of their chosen sports and Group training sessions where the user can train as part of a group and further enhance their Fundamentals and Team skills required for the sport. </p>
								<p>A user can also create teams and join teams for various sports at a Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced level. The App also maintains a leaderboard similar to the likes of Uber where a user can give other users a star rating so people can spend the limited time they may have for a sport optimally. A user can use in-app messaging to talk to and maintain contacts that they have met through the app. Ultimately, participating in a sport ‘Sports Hub’ will make it easier to Enter and easier to gain more knowledge about any chosen sports that are featured on the App. </p>
								<p></p>
								<h4 class="major">Topic</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/marvel1.PNG" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p> ‘Sports Hub’ is designed for sports lovers, As in Australia more than 90% of adults have an interest in sports (Australian Government, Department of Health) but it seems hard to begin getting into sports as you get older. This app makes this process much easier. </p>
								<p> Community sport infrastructure is estimated to generate an annual value of more than 16.2 billion to Australia. With 6.3 billion worth of economic benefit (Australian Government: Australian Sports Commision, The Value of Community Sport Infrastructure, 2018) Making this app tap into a billion dollar market. </p>
								<p>(Australian Government, Department of Health) <br><a href="https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/sport">Health Sport Topics</a><br></p>
								<p></p>
								<h4 class="major">Motivation</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/running1.PNG" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p>‘Sports Hub’ gives people an outlet to be more active. In 2017–18, an estimated 2 in 3 (67%) Australians aged 18 and over were overweight or obese (36% were overweight but not obese, and 31% were obese). That’s around 12.5 million adults. (Australian Government: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Overweight and obesity, 2020). </p>
								<p>Almost 4 in 10 adults aged 18–64 (37%) reported Not enough time or Too many other commitments as the main barriers to participating in sport or recreational physical activities. As age increased, Poor health or injury was more frequently cited as the main barrier—increasing from almost one-fifth (18%) of those aged 35–44 to almost half (48%) of adults aged 65 and over. (Australian Government: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Physical activity across the life stages, pg.7). This app will make it easier to have enough time because it will be easier to track where to start from and reduce poor health or injury barrier by having an overall more healthy population as the App makes it easier to be active. </p>
								<p>This app uses models demonstrated by Uber and similar apps but pigeon-holes it to physical activity in particular sports and participating in them. A future employer will see this as an innovation combining coaching and team finding in the one App tapping into a profitable market. Ultimately showing that we are forward thinkers.</p>

								<p> </p>
								<h4 class="major">LandScape</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IOSicon.png" alt="Logo" /></span>
								<p> This app is similar to Uber in terms of how it works with map integration and reviewing purposes in order to help people complete the task of finding a sports team, club or coach optimally. In the market there’s an App called Teamer which finds Teams and an App called ‘Possible’ that finds Personal trainers. We can use these as guidelines to create our App that is unique to them both by hitting both markets and being an overall more accessible and encompassing version for users to interact with. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Detailed Description</h2>



								<h4 class="major">Aims</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aims.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The aim of the app will be to bring together groups and individuals who wish to take part in public sports and utilise sporting grounds provided by private companies and councils. Users will be able to login to their accounts and view areas which are free to use through a mobile app or on desktop. A mobile app would probably be the better option as it can be used on the go. </p>
								<p>Uses of databases will also be required to store user information and locations of sporting areas will be a major component, users will be able to create profiles and information about them will need to be kept safe and secure. This way they are also able to quickly login and retrieve all the same information that they wanted stored. </p>
								<p>Creating an interesting UI will also be an aim when developing the app, creating something that will attract users but also keep them using it is something that is important. We want users to constantly be updating whether sporting areas are free to use, checking sporting scores and just checking sporting news.</p>
								<p>In order to get the app to reach a wider audience, we will need to place some emphasis on promoting and advertising the app. We’ll be creating ads and logos to achieve this. Promoting the ad on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tik Tok would reach the widest amount of people, but also create an eye-catching logo that would spark interest in the app. Also, trying to get social media influencers to promote the app would be another way to get the app’s name spread.</p>


							<h4 class="major">Plans and Progress</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/plan.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our project is about a multiplatform app called ‘SportsHub’, which lets users find sports facilities around them and contact personal trainers, coaches, and get updates on sports events happening around them. The app will use GPS features to locate all sports facilities, including grounds, courts, recreation centres, etc. The user will be able to see scores, rankings, and progress of local sports teams. Users will have access to contacts of personal trainers, sports teams, and other recreation sports.	</p>

								<p>The application will be accessible to both android and iOS users. The main purpose of this app will be to provide users with quality data on sports activities and locations around them and keep their personal data safe. Privacy will be a big focus of this project, the app will be secured with login id and password, the user's personal details will be encrypted, and security measures will be taken while coding the application to protect it from malware and hackers. As the user information will be stored using databases, security measures like firewalls, antiviruses and regular maintenance of the database will be crucial. There will be a variety of important user data like credit card details they used to pay for trainers/coaches, their preferences, favourite sports, and personal information. Considering the vast amount of important user data, cybersecurity will be a huge focus of the app development to protect the data.  </p>

								<p>As we are inexperienced in developing mobile applications, we are going to create this app with a software called ‘Appypie’ mainly because it is very efficient in making apps and easy to use for beginners in app development. Appypie will help us develop the app with ease and not have to deal with legal formalities and long processes of acquiring licences for the application. We can also use templates, watch tutorials, and learn more about mobile application development from Appypie’s inbuilt features. Not to mention, thousands of videos on YouTube and other platforms that can teach us how to use Appypie and develop a fantastic mobile application. We will use the ‘marvel’ app to create prototypes of what the application will look like, which can help us with early testing and debugging. A functionality map will be created in order to ensure all the functional requirements are achieved and the logic of the app is correct.   </p>

								<p>We would have to go through several phases to get to the result. If we consider Sports Hub, the product will go through at least seven stages of development. The stages of product development are as follows: </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/development.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<ol>
									<li>Ideation and concept:
									<br>Defining the product concept and the initial information or discussion/brainstorm where the product idea came from. This will help with having a clear vision of what is being produced and what the final outcome will roughly look like. </li>
									<br><li>Market research:
									<br>Researching and studying the market to understand the user demands and current options available to users. By studying the market you can learn what the market demands and if there are any “gaps” in the market, meaning products that there is a need/demand for in the market but are not yet available. You can then try to fill that “gap” by creating a product that will meet those requirements and demands.</li>
									<br><li>Business plan:
									<br>A plan will help with developing and marketing the product. It will also calculate at what point the business will become profitable and analyse the lifetime value of the product. This analysis can help with investments and resources put into creating the product according to the projected profit and value of the product.</li>
									<br><li>Prototype:
									<br>Once you have a business plan a prototype would be ideal, as it can help test the product, can be shown to business partners/investors, used for marketing purposes, etc. </li>
									<br><li>Crowdfunding:
									<br>Crowdfunding is a way to generate financial profits before the product is even finished. You can learn a lot by crowdfunding, such as getting first customer and investors feedback. This can help you gain more resources and knowledge about your customers before launching the finished product.</li>
									<br><li>Design and production:
									<br>After crowdfunding you have received feedback and important market data from your first customers. This should help you create the design structure and start the production of your finished product. It could be creating databases for an application you want to create.</li>
									<br><li>Marketing and distribution:
									<br>Now that the protection is finished and the product is launched, you need to advertise the product using social media, TV, ect. This will help you gain more profit and build customer loyalty, also will increase customers and demand of your product in the market. </li>
								</ol>

                <span class="image main"><img src="images/prog.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>‘SportsHub’ has been planned to be developed in the next few months. The outcome of this project would be to create an app accessible to both android and iOS platforms. This will hopefully help the users find recreation around them and enjoy the local resources they have. We have come to a point where the functional and non-functional requirements of this project are decided. The main features like GPS accessibility, records of sports teams match and contact of training facilities and personal trainers.</p>

								<p>We started this project by picking a project idea from our group members personal project ideas from Assignment 1. From which Ghania’s idea was selected as it was complex and useful, also easy to create with our current skills. We started to work on a detailed description of this project in Assignment 2, which included creating a team profile and researching IT technologies such as cryptocurrencies, automation, etc. An interview was done by Ghania with an IT specialist as a part of the Assignment, to collect information on the work of IT professionals and understand what their daily work looks like. We researched the skills required to create the project idea we agreed on. Then compare those skills with the skills we need for our future pathways, also with skills we currently have. Roles were assigned to the team members as to what professionals would be required to build the mobile app.</p>

								<p>The project has progressed very smoothly so far. Eric will take the role of the lead developer to make use of his good leadership skills. Creative director will be Ghania as the project the idea was originally hers. Danny and Jake would work as full stack developers to do front end and back-end web programming. Karanvir is the software tester as he is focusing on tools and testing. We have created a website specifically for the project in Assignment 2, with all the required skills, tools, hardware, software,and legal requirements mentioned in detail.</p>

								<p>We are currently creating artefacts in the form of a functionality map, wireframes, logos, and an Instagram ad. The prototype was designed carefully after we decided on what the prototype will look like and how it will help us test the original application. We will use the prototype created with ‘marvel’ app along with a functionality map to test and debug for any problems. The functionality map will be used as a reference to how the prototype and the original app will behave, process information, respond, etc. The flow of data and storage will also be tested, the format of stored data(CSV,text,etc), search algorithms, file handling. Furthermore the application will be promoted with a social media ad we have created along with logos for the application to attract users who are searching for applications similar to ours. The advertisement will help us get the app out there in the market and attract the focused audience (people looking for a sporting application).</p>

								<p>Another website will be prepared for this, and its main focus would be on a mock-up of the finished software solution and a plan to follow, which will help us keep track of our progress, tasks and deadlines when we start developing the app. </p>

                <p>For the plan we will have a ‘timeframe’ in the form of a table with tasks assigned for each week and make entries to it as we progress and complete milestones throughout the development process.</p>

								<p>While working as a team to plan out this project we didn’t really follow any major dead ends, but we still made deadlines for small milestones throughout the assignment to stay on top of our work and not fall behind too much. The schedule for Assignment 3 was a little behind as one of our members got very sick and couldn’t help for a few days with the project. However, we are still looking forward to submitting the assignment before the deadline with time to spare, all thanks to the team being very supportive and completing work, and posting updates in the team's  group chat to keep the sick team member up to date with what we were up to and what needed to be done. The team made all the decisions by discussing all the options carefully in our meetings, and everyone had their say in the decisions made. The communication so far has been very good compared to Assignment 2 and everyone is comfortable sharing their ideas with the group, which makes our team meetings all the more efficient in planning and completing tasks. No last-minute changes were made during this whole project, because everything was decided in our team meetings as a group ahead of time, how the tasks will be assigned, the template of the website, artefact materials and other aspects of the project. This helped us to not be stuck with making last minute decisions or waste time discussing what to do in the later stages of the assignment. </p>

                <p>Only thing we changed was the template from Assignment 2. As we received feedback from Assignment 2 saying we need to be more precise with our points, we decided to pick a new template which will allow the user to access different parts of the project very quickly and not make it seem very lengthy and hard to find certain information. </p>

						<h4 class="major">Scopes and Limits</h4>
							<p>Artefacts that will be produced to show some proof of work will be various plans and outlines of the app. These sections will come together and assist us with working towards the finalisation of the app. Collating the separate sections will drastically cut down on work time and we can spend more time fine-tuning minor details in the app.  </p>
							<p>We’ll be using the website, ‘Marvel’ , to create these said outlines and plans and these will assist in guiding us along the right path to creating a final product. Within Moqups, we can create a brief design, allocating sections of an app to items, the design section will allow us to visualise our concept. This is where a basic knowledge of creating wireframes would be helpful as navigating and being able to think up of basic designs would be useful, Jacob has had some 				experience creating wireframes in the past. Alongside Jacob, Ghania and Karanvir will be assisting him in creating wireframes and prototypes. </p>
							<p>Creating mock ups and different versions of the final product will be crucial, ideas will always change and what may sound good at first, may not appear to be as good as they were expected to. Having different websites and apps that can create a quick look into how a page or an ad may look would cut down a lot of the time needed when creating a full Facebook page. We will be using websites like Carousel to create how an ad would look like on Instagram before allocating money to sponsor it onto Instagram and publishing it. We also used a website called Cello to create a quick mock graphic design ad to put into our Carousel ad. These creative ideas would have stemmed from other visual ideas that we would have seen on other social media platforms and sites, so creating an inspiration board on Canva helped with keeping and utilising ideas from other sources.<p>
							<p>When creating the prototype for the app, a logo will also be required to go alongside with the app. This way we are able to get a better visual representation of the app. Danny has had previous experience creating visual arts projects. The logo will also be something that will be used in promotional activities, these will include ads, adverts, websites and will be used on the app. </p>
							<p>An Instagram ad will be used for promoting the app. Utilising social media as a platform to spread the word about ‘Sports Hub’ would be the easiest way possible. Instagram being one of the most used social media platforms will create the biggest reach. The ad needs to be eye-catching and appeal to people varying all ages and social groups. This is what we believe is going to bring together the most people. </p>

They can design the UI/UX to a specific information architecture which ensures the user has the best experience with our App. </p>
									<p>They use their empathy to understand and test the UI/UX to ensure that it is functional and meaningful to their user. They have good organisation skills that allow our project to run smoothly.  They can potentially code a bit to help other areas in the project complete on time but this is not necessarily needed. They make our App appealing to our target audience which at the end of the day is most important to ensure it sells/is used by our users. They use prototyping tools similar to what we will use for the project i.e Invision, Moqups and Marvel. They can use Adobe XD to create vector designs as they create clean designs and They can conduct user-testing through Maze to gain user feedback. </p>

									<h4 class="major">Ghania's Reflection</h4>
										<p>Everyone in my group is extremely cooperative, and I am grateful to have met such pleasant individuals in this topic. Each member is committed to this subject and assists one another with this project. Except for one or two occasions, everyone was on time for our group meeting; nonetheless, everyone watched the recording and performed their duties, which were distributed evenly among all team members. One area where I believe the group can make significant improvements is communication. I've seen that some team members are hesitant to speak out, but everyone works in a very professional manner. This project has shown that a team is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Assessing and recognizing our talents, as well as putting them together to build something more powerful than any of us individually, was critical to what we accomplished. Working in this group, I believe, will assist me in developing the necessary skills and confidence to obtain my desired career. </p>
									<h4 class="major">Eric's Reflection</h4>
										<p>Overall, the group worked pretty well together. There were some drop offs in assignment 3 in comparison to assignment 2, however most of those issues were quickly resolved as time went on. Each member was able to commit enough time to get the assignment completed within a timely manner and each member worked together extremely well. Having a clear understanding of what the expectations were definitely helped with guiding each member towards the right direction in completing tasks for the week. </p>
									<h4 class="major">Karan's Reflection</h4>
										<p>All members of the group showed excellent work rate and dedication to the project and got tasks done on time. We were a bit behind on schedule as compared to Assignment 2, but it didn’t delay us too much. We can improve by picking our meeting times more carefully. A few of us couldn’t make it to the team meetings due to some other work that needed to be done on that day. Also, I got very sick last week and couldn’t contribute to the Assignment for a few days, but surprisingly the team didn’t fall behind too much. I learned a lot by working in this group, the members are very understanding and capable, and even if there were a few problems we overcame them as a team very easily. Other things I learned like syntax of HTML and a lot of CSS will be very helpful with my studies and future pathway. Overall, everyone was mostly always on time to meetings and kept each other up to date, we have done an amazing job with the prototype and the website looks very professional. I am very proud of all the team members for helping me learn many things and completing the project on time. </p>
									<h4 class="major">Danny's Reflection</h4>
										<p>Honestly, Group OWO was a great group. Every member was able to complete all tasks at a very high level which led us to a great score of 79 in assignment 2. I can’t say how much it means that working with my first ever group for uni turned out so great because I hear people say certain groups this and that which kinda made didn’t want to be in a group. Everyone is very nice and supportive in the group so it’s nice to know that they got your back in case. Sadly this will be our last assignment together and hopefully we can aim for a high distinction for this assignment 3. I am very happy we got put together.</p>
									<h4 class="major">Jacob's Reflection</h4>
										<p>Overall I am happy with everyone's work and dedication to this assignment. Multiple of us had assignments for other subjects but worked extremely hard to not only communicate obstacles but finish their parts of the project. There were delays in understanding of the project element of this assignment but we worked well to get on track once we had figured it out. Everyone in the group was present for most meetings and we always established a path to success in these meetings. We did seem to improve in terms of our response time taking a cue from our last assignment. This assignment meeting times were sometimes hard to commit to but I think we had enough meetings to ensure the project runs smoothly. In the future it will be easier to assess this by knowing the best availabilities and working with that.</p>
										<p>This group is easily the best group I've had to work with and I'm very happy with what we have achieved. Through support and understanding we just buckled down and got this done with obstacles that could’ve made it extremely difficult. Having dreaded group projects in the past this will be the benchmark of what I would hope to achieve again for a team in a professional environment and It has changed my perspective of group work in the future.</p>
									<h4 class="major">Group Reflection</h4>
										<p>Everyone was able to work together easily and efficiently. Having someone like Eric take the leader role to point out what needs to be completed and when made it easy to delegate tasks. Everyone in the group was able to contribute their current and previous skill sets towards the final project. We were also able to split the work up evenly like we did in assignment 2. There were also no real disagreements within the group which made it easy to communicate with one another. Overall, the group was super easy to work with and everyone was collaborating together effectively. </p>
										<p>The biggest thing that could be improved upon would be communication. Although it was an issue that we had identified within assignment 2, there is definitely more room for improvement when it came to communicating what was going on in and out of the assignment. Keeping up to date with how other members were going with their sections and if anyone needed assistance alleviating some of the stress by asking. <br>
										Referring back to the last reflection, checking up on messages or simply having notifications turned on through the mobile app would have been a great way to keep posted with what was happening within the group. We probably could have created a group chat alongside the Teams group so messages would be regularly checked.<br>
										Furthermore, being more strict on deadlines and the assignment of tasks. When things weren’t completed they would be pushed to the next session. Although, it didn’t really seem to have too much of an effect on the final product, having the work completed by the deadline would make the final product less stressful to submit. </p>
										<p>Although there were issues with communication as a whole, the work that was produced was definitely of a satisfactory standard. Everyone was able to designate enough time to get the work done and still communicate with each other. There was also an improvement in communication within the group, it wasn’t to an exceptional level but the increase in communication led to multiple members taking lead and making it easier to work collectively.</p>
										<p>One thing that we have all learnt through assignment 2 and assignment 3 is that putting our ideas and skills together is a major factor in creating the final product. Communication is something that will make or break a lot of the assignment, having ineffective or poor communication methods meant that members weren’t on the same page or they weren’t able to contribute to the assignment evenly. So establishing proper means of communication will be taken into account going forward. </p>
